# Exception unifier sample
## Introduction
This is parent project of all sample projects.

We can go to the README of each child subject to learn more.
## Common knowledge
For all example, exception enum code will be prefixed by their own annotation `ExceptionSource` first.

Then it'll be prefixed by module level exception code prefix which is provided differently.

And the separator is `:`.

## Examples
1. To learn about base usage which is provided by `ConfigurableExceptionCodePrefixSupplier`, go to [base](base/README.md)
2. To learn about remote usage which is provided by `RemoteExceptionCodePrefixSupplier`, go to [remote](remote/README.md)
